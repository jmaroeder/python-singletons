Usage
=====

One of the simplest ways to use ``singletons`` is using a factory decorator to make the return value of a function a singleton object. Create a ``shared.py`` file::

    import uuid
	import singletons

    @singletons.GlobalFactory
    def my_uuid():
        return uuid.uuid4()

Any time you want to access the instance generated by your factory, just call the ``my_uuid()`` function.

Factory decorators include:

- :class:`~singletons.GlobalFactory`
- :class:`~singletons.ProcessFactory`
- :class:`~singletons.ThreadFactory`
- :class:`~singletons.GreenthreadFactory`
- :class:`~singletons.EventletFactory`
- :class:`~singletons.GeventFactory`

You can also declare a class as a singleton by using the ``metaclass`` keyword argument::

    import singletons

    class SharedCache(dict, metaclass=singletons.ThreadSingleton):
        pass

When ``SharedCache`` is called (using ``SharedCache()``), if an object already exists for the current thread it is returned, otherwise it is constructed.

Singleton metaclasses include:

- :class:`~singletons.Singleton`
- :class:`~singletons.ProcessSingleton`
- :class:`~singletons.ThreadSingleton`
- :class:`~singletons.GreenthreadSingleton`
- :class:`~singletons.EventletSingleton`
- :class:`~singletons.GeventSingleton`

Writing Tests
-------------

A common need when working with singletons is to be able to use Mock objects for unit tests. ``singletons`` includes a helper class for making modules easily swappable to use Mocks for everything instead of the factories/classes defined. A common usage would be to put these lines at the bottom of your ``shared.py`` file::

    class _Shared(singletons.SharedModule):
        globals = globals()
    sys.modules[__name__] = _Shared()

To enable the Mock object replacement, call `setup_mock()` or set the environment variable ``SINGLETONS_SETUP_MOCK=1``. This will replace all accesses of module attributes with Mock() instances. ``setup_mock`` can be called inside a TestCase ``setup()`` method or as part of a pytest fixture to ensure that each test has a clean set of Mock() instances.

Example test::

    class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def setup(self):
            shared.setup_mock()

        def test_get_documents():
            c = shared.session()
            # do thing
            c.request.assert_called_once()

To use custom Mock objects, set them as attributes on the module after calling ``setup_mock``::

    class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def setup(self):
            shared.setup_mock()
            mock_instance = mock.Mock(spec=User)
            mock_instance.name = 'Jane Doe'
            mock_instance.username = 'jdoe123'
            shared.mock_instance = mock_instance

        def test_get_userdata():
            c = shared.mock_instance()
            # do thing
            c.request.assert_called_once()
